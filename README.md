## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to implement Re3 in PyTorch, update the code, and enable training as a new module. By integrating Re3 with YOLOv8 technology, we aim to create a robust object tracking system.



## Usage

if you have GPU you should change GPU_ID in **constant.py**
To utilize a GPU, ensure that the GPU_ID in constant.py is set correctly.

The project contains two main files:

Demo/re3_save.py: Tracks a specified initial_bbox within a given video and records the process. Paths specified in this file must be updated according to your project configuration.
Demo/re3_yolo8_clean.py: This file works with the YOLOv8 algorithm for object tracking. Ensure that all paths are correctly set in this file as well.

```bash
pip3 install ultralytics
```

It's crucial to set the paths correctly for both files to ensure the system operates as intended.







## Training

To train this algorithm, you need a continuous sequence of frames for your object. You must create two files: **labels_small_boxes.npy** and **image_names.txt** and place them in the training/datasets/Imagenet_Video/labels directory.

The script **training/datasets/make_lab.py** is provided to generate these two files. Ensure you read the comments in this script before running it.

after that you have run from training folder

```bash
python unrolled_solver.py -rtc -n 2 -b 64
```

This is the Official Repository for Re3 in PyTorch. However, it has some significant differences between it and the [TensorFlow repository](https://github.com/danielgordon10/re3-tensorflow).
1. Due to PyTorch's dynamic graph construction, the network can now be trained one unroll at a time. This means less time preprocessing the images, but also it doesn't parallelize as well.
1. The simulation code is removed as it does not work with this one unroll setup.
1. The code is Python 3 compatible and encouraged.

## First Time Setup:
I have switched from virtualenv to Anaconda because it allows for easier CUDA integration. The setup is much the same as in the TensorFlow version.
```bash
conda create -n re3-pytorch-env python=3.6.8
conda env update -n re3-pytorch-env -f env.yml
```

## Model:
The model weights we used in our paper were ported from Caffe to Tensorflow and then to PyTorch. There may be slight differences in performance from the original paper.
Weights can be downloaded by running 

`sh download_weights_large.sh`

A smaller network trained in PyTorch is also available. Its performance is worse, but it is significantly faster.
These weights can be downloaded by running 

`sh download_weights_small.sh`.

Additionally, set `USE_SMALL_NET = True` in [constants.py](constants.py).

## Run the Demo:
1. [Download the pretrained weights](#model)
1. Run `python demo/image_demo.py`


## Folders and Files:
### Most important for using Re3 in a new project:
1. [tracker/re3_tracker.py](tracker/re3_tracker.py) - The tracker file for actually tracking objects.
1. [tracker/network.py](tracker/network.py) - The network file specifying the layout of Re3.
1. [constants.py](constants.py) - A place to put constants that are used in multiple files such as image size and log location.

### Most important for (re)training Re3 on new data:
1. [Training Readme](training/README.md)
1. [Dataset Readme](training/datasets/README.md)
1. [training/unrolled_solver.py](training/unrolled_solver.py)

Re3 is released under the GPL V3.
